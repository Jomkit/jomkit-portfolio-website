				<h2>What I've Been Up To</h2>
				<div class="space-y-2">
					<p><b>Open-Source:</b> Recently I've been dabbling in open-source contributions, and having a whale of a time. Something I didn't realize was how much of a great opportunity it is to learn new technology and practice the software engineering workflow.</p> 

					<p>In this case I had to pick up enough <a class="underline hover:font-bold" href="https://angular.dev/">Angular</a> to start making contributions. Check out the project! It's an open-source idle game: <a class="hover:underline" href="https://glowriftduskhall.felfhenor.com/">Glowrift-Duskhall</a></p>
					<p><b>Learning Skills:</b> I decided to take the plunge on learning a new programming language this year, and I decided to pick up Java.</p>

				<h2>Hobbies</h2>

					<p>In my free time I like keeping up with new software trends, networking with other professionals, and exploring new hobbies.</p>

						<h3>Axe Throwing</h3>
						<p>Axe throwing is one of those hobbies that I've grown passionate about. It exemplifies all the things I like about software engineering: it is impressive to watch a skilled practitioner throw their axe but even more exciting to experience it for yourself, learning all the skill and nuance that goes into perfecting the throw.</p>
