### A Little About Me

I'm a full-stack software engineer with a passion for learning new technologies, keeping up with tech trends, and discovering unexpected connections between software engineering and seemingly unrelated fields. Take backend and frontend development, for example: two closely related yet distinct disciplines within software engineering. Many assume backend is for the "calculated types" and frontend is for the "creative types," but we, as full-stack developers, know they're just two sides of the same coin.\
\
I'm driven by the excitement of building something newâ€”something that makes people say, "Wow, that's awesome!" or "Finally, an app that solves my problem." I believe creativity isn't just innate; it can be nurtured through effort, time, and, most importantly, fun. That's why I'm always exploring new hobbies, whether they're software-related or not.\
\
I'm someone who enjoys trying new things, whether it's a new tech stack (Astro started out that way for me!) or a new hobby like axe throwing. This love for exploration helps me stay on top of trends, remain agile and open-minded, and tap into my creative side. I'm constantly reminded of the thrill of being a learner and the inspiration that comes from those who have mastered their craft.\

To stay active, I practice boxing and other martial arts, go jump roping, or head out for a run. When it's time to unwind, I enjoy diving into a good book, watching a great movie, or playing video games to relax.
