## Welcome!

This blog, and the website as a whole was designed and developed by me, Jomkit Jujaroen, as a way to show off some of my projects, my technical skills, my interests, and my ever continuing journey as a Software Engineer. I hope to record my experience learning new things, both programming related and not. Sometimes I might veer off on a tangent, but I'll try my best to relate it back to software engineering.\
\
Above all else, I hope to add value to you, the reader; I would be absolutely over the moon if I can teach you something or help you figure out a problem. If not, then I hope I can at least expose to you some hidden interest you've been waiting to discover.\
\
Recognizing that I'm always in a process of trying, learning, failing, and improving, I'm sure there'll be a great many things I mess up or get wrong. So I ask for your patience, dear reader, and above all else your support in rectifying my mistakes so that I can learn, and ultimately we raise everyone up.
