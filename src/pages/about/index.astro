                            <p>I learned fundamental software engineering principles and methodologies from the online bootcamp, Springboard. I participated remotely from August 2023, and graduated in August 2024.</p>
                            <p>I've had the pleasure of trying out plenty of new and exciting technologies, including Google Cloud Platform, Docker, and Next.js, sometimes for work and sometimes for personal exploration.

                            <p>As an engineer, I love learning how things work. I've always been passionate about building things. As a kid I was at my most focused when I was putting together Star Wars lego sets, and as I grew older that turned into making cosplay, assembling Gundam model kits, and ultimately led me to the Rochester Institute of Technology for a bachelors in Electrical/Mechanical Engineering Technology.</p>
                            
                            <h3>My Current Hobbies</h3>
                            <a href="/about/hobbies" class="underline hover:text-blue-500">Learn more...</a>
                            <p>On the hobby side I've been doing a lot of axe throwing. I love trying different things and exploring new industries because I believe that creative solutions lie at the intersection of unexpected topics.</p>
