# Portfolio Website by Jomkit Jujaroen

Hello, thanks for stopping by the github repository for my portfolio website. I scaffolded the project from an astro template, just to save myself a bit of boiler plate, and then after that I was off to the races.

This website features most of the usual amenities: landing page, works and services, blog, about, and contact pages. It is continuously a work in progress, but what better way to showcase my skills as a web developer than writing my own living portfolio website?

## Icons

This project uses [astro-icon](https://www.astroicon.dev/getting-started/) package to simplify use of icons, and the [BoxIcons](https://icones.js.org/collection/bx) set by Atisa. 

To add more icons go to use the `Icon` component and set the `name` attribute to the desired icon, referencing the icon set from the following link: https://icones.js.org/collection/bx 

## ðŸš€ Project Structure (Astro bootstrapped)

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
